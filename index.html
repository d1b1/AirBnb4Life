      <h4>Short Term Rental Ordinance by City of Boston</h4>

      <p>
        Boston is looking to restrict investor unit short term rentals to 90
        nights per year which would essentially shut down short term rentals by
        investors. These restrictions will cause the numbers of units to drop
        dramatically, rates to rise and will impact many local jobs, leaving
        house cleaners, managers, restaurant workers and local shop owners unemployed.
